Original readme
These are R code scripts for running boosted regression tree models (BRT) 
models and making predictions. 

When working with many species, the process can be very time and memory consuming, 
so is best done in a parallel computing environment. The comupte-canada folder 
has the code for doing this on Compute Canada. 

The archive folder has the original code form Peter Solymos from the
